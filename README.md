This is a project for my YouTube channel where I build every week a new feature until I have a full Dapp on Next.js 13's app directory and MetaMask.

## Progression

- Part 1 (current branch): Implenting wallet connection and Cookie session
- Part 2: Watching changes in wallet and network
- Part 3: Implementing SIWE (Sign in with Ethereum)
